# Infinite Layers NG+3 Edition

A purely cosmetic mod of dan-simon's Infinite Layers, where the names of the prestige layers are changed to the current and planned prestige layer names of Aarex's NG+3 mod of Antimatter Dimensions.

Well, not purely cosmetic anymore, because some QoL features are added too.
